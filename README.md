# ðŸ›‘ Crosswalk Detection and Traffic Signal Assistance System

A real-time crosswalk detection system that recognizes both pedestrians and vehicles using YOLOv8, and provides visual safety feedback based on simulated traffic light logic.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This system simulates an urban crosswalk equipped with traffic signals and computer vision. It performs:

- Pedestrian and vehicle detection via YOLOv8 (`yolov8m.pt`)
- Traffic signal simulation (automatic RED/GREEN switching)
- On-screen annotations like `CROSS! (person)` or `STOP (car)` based on safety context
- Result video export and ESC-key termination
- Fully modular design: `main.py`, `detector.py`, `drawing.py`, `traffic_signal.py`

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python pillow

Place crosswalk_cctv.mp4 in data/ and yolov8m.pt in models/.

Run the system:

bash
python main.py
Press ESC to exit. The result will be saved as data/result.mp4.

ðŸ§  Key Features
